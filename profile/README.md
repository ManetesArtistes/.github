# ManetesArtistes - Introduction

Welcome to **ManetesArtistes**! This is our first project as part of our course, and we are excited to share it with you. Our project is a fun and creative drawing and coloring app designed for children aged 2 to 3 years. It was created at the request of a client who wanted an engaging way for young children to explore their creativity in a safe and easy-to-use environment.

Our team consists of **rwxce**, **jazdevv**, **Ivan-Fdez-Ba**, and **jordibonet**. Together, we have worked to bring this project to life, ensuring it is both entertaining and educational for young children. We hope this app brings joy and inspiration to its little users!

Thank you for visiting our project!
